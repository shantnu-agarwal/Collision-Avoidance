# Collision-Avoidance

Sketch1.ino avoids with differential drive

### Sketch 1 is the DRIVE SYSTEM.

### Compilation is the FINAL COMPLETE CODE.

Trial_2.ino does arc motion with forward drive

Project made with Team Rudra to use N sensors to implement collision avoidance on an autonomous bot. 

Gyroscope provides dual angle position

### GYRO now works with Temperature

## Drive signals from Arduino to Pi through SPI.
